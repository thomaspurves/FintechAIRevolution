### (April 2023)
* Autogpt is a prototype framework that now runs GPT-4 running fully autonomously. It can browse the web, has short and long term memory, can write and fix code, set tasks, access popular platforms and even speak. Use with caution, but this is on the way to creating AI businesses processes (or whole businesses!) that run themselves. \[[Link](https://twitter.com/SigGravitas/status/1642181498278408193)\]

## Strategic Implications of Generative AI in Fintech

### For Incumbents
Positive Disruption and advantages:
* Existing reach, channels and brand trust for distributing AI solutions. Winning customer trust being the major leverageable factor here in winning adoption. 
* Improved risk assessment and underwriting with AI-generated predictive models and data analysis.
* Enhanced customer experiences through personalized insurance products, pricing, and claims processing
* Streamlined operations and reduced costs with AI-driven automation of tasks like claims processing, policy administration, and fraud detection.
* Enhanced decision-making and advisory services through AI-generated insights and predictive analytics
* Opportunity to scale and automate lower marging professional service-driven functions like wealth management, advisory, accounting 
* Huge opportunities in recapturing and sharing institutional knowledge, in mitigating communication and beuracratic overheads across large multi-departmental organizations

Negative Disruption:
* Increased competition from insurtech startups leveraging AI-driven solution
* Job role disruptions and challenges with internal change managment
* May move to slow to introduce new AI-driven value proposition and face increased competition from new entrants and startups
* Infrastructure players (from cloud vendors to SaaS suppliers) may rent-seek or capture outsized share of new value created by AI.
* Risk, regulatory uncertainties and compliance challenges may block or slow adoption from incumbents more so than new entrants/startups
* Traditional service-driven sectors like wealth management, accounting  struggle to compete with low-cost, AI-driven robo-advisors, pressuring fees and profit margin
